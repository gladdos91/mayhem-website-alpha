Mayhem Industries Gaming Network is a community built for gamers, by gamers. We host dedicated servers across multiple titles, starting with Space Engineers and Rust, as well as Stormworks, Minecraft, Valheim, Enshrouded, and more. Our servers are designed to deliver reliable performance, fair rules, and a welcoming environment where players can truly enjoy their games.<br/><br/>

Our mission is to create a space where players can connect, collaborate, and game without the frustration of toxic communities or unstable servers. With a dedicated admin team, supportive staff, and a focus on respect and inclusivity, Mayhem Industries is more than just a gaming network, it's a growing family of players who share a passion for building, exploring, surviving, and having fun together.<br/><br/>

Whether you’re here to engineer massive creations, fight for survival, or just relax and make new friends, you'll always have a place in our community.<br/><br/>
